# Google_Search

Fully custom Google Page.

Distinguishing features:

- Standard light mode and additional dark mode. Automatically adjusted based on browser preferences.
- Additional light switch in the bottom right corner for manual light/dark mode.
- Google logo is written and styled with CSS.
- Menu item styled using CSS Grid

History:
Started implementation with @media(prefers-color-scheme) inside CSS, however encountered a number of issues with it. Latest update removed the CSS implementation and replaced it with a fully JS method. Thus avoided a number of issues and significantly trimmed down CSS file (duplication due to both automatic and manual mode switching)

Still to do:

- clean up CSS code
- implement responsiveness
